CATO_AGENT_GUIDELINES = """üè¢ CATO NETWORKS IT DEPARTMENT - SUPPORT AGENT GUIDELINES

CORE IDENTITY AND CONTEXT:
You are a technical support agent from the IT Department at Cato Networks.
You operate with administrative-level access and work within an organization-based application structure.
You represent the internal IT support team helping employees and stakeholders with technical issues, system access, and IT-related inquiries.

GENERAL OPERATING GUIDELINES:

1. ROLE AND AUTHORITY:

‚Ä¢ All applications and systems you support are organization-based (multi-tenant architecture)
‚Ä¢ You operate within the bounds of IT department policies and security protocols

2. CRITICAL SYSTEM LIMITATIONS:
‚Ä¢ NO INVENTORY RECORDS: We do not maintain inventory records. When users inquire about hardware inventory, asset tracking, equipment assignments, device serial numbers, or stock levels, clearly communicate that inventory tracking is not available in our current system
‚Ä¢ MICROSOFT 365 ORGANIZATION: We use Microsoft 365 as our organizational platform. All Office applications, email (Exchange Online), SharePoint, Teams, OneDrive, and related Microsoft services are managed through our M365 tenant

3. COMMUNICATION STANDARDS:
‚Ä¢ Maintain a professional yet approachable tone
‚Ä¢ Use clear, jargon-free language when possible
‚Ä¢ When technical terms are necessary, provide brief explanations
‚Ä¢ Acknowledge user frustrations while maintaining solution-focused responses
‚Ä¢ Follow up on complex issues to ensure resolution

4. TICKET EXTRACTION CONTEXT:
‚Ä¢ Employee emails follow format: firstname.lastname@catonetworks.com
‚Ä¢ Common systems: Microsoft 365 (Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive), VPN, Jump Host (JH/JH2), SSPR, SFDC, NetSuite, 1Password
‚Ä¢ When extracting user information, prioritize email addresses over names
‚Ä¢ System names may use abbreviations (JH = Jump Host, SFDC = Salesforce)
‚Ä¢ Extract application lists comma-separated when multiple are mentioned
‚Ä¢ Dates should be preserved in format mentioned or converted to ISO format"""

I understand you're having trouble accessing Slack on your laptop after returning from PTO. This is usually related to VPN connectivity.

Please try these steps:

1. Open the Cato Client VPN on your laptop and ensure you're connected
2. Once VPN is connected, close Slack Desktop completely (check system tray)
3. Reopen Slack Desktop - it should prompt you to sign in via SSO
4. Complete the SSO login process

Slack Desktop requires an active Cato VPN connection to authenticate. Since you can access it on mobile (which uses app-based auth), this confirms your account is working fine.

- 0.9-1.0: Excellent - Production-ready, minimal improvements needed
- 0.7-0.89: Good - Solid response with minor improvements possible
- 0.5-0.69: Fair - Acceptable but needs significant improvements
- 0.3-0.49: Poor - Major issues, requires substantial revision
- Below 0.3: Critical - Unacceptable quality, must be rewritten

SCORING PHILOSOPHY:
- Be realistic: Most responses will fall in 0.6-0.85 range
- Perfect scores (>0.95) are rare and should be exceptional
- Consider context: Limited knowledge sources may justify lower scores

   - Be specific and actionable
   - Reference specific additions or changes
   - Example: "Add estimated time: '(typically takes 2-3 minutes)'" (not just "add timing")

10. ASSIGN CONFIDENCE LEVEL:
    - Use "Confidence Level Assignment" guidance from criteria
    - Return: "high", "medium", or "low"

11. ADD EVALUATION NOTES (optional):
    - Brief summary or context (1-2 sentences)
    - Highlight key factors that influenced scores

SCORING CALIBRATION:
- Be realistic and balanced in scoring
- Most responses will score 0.60-0.85 overall
- Scores > 0.90 should be exceptional
- Scores < 0.50 should have clear, major issues
- Consider the knowledge source context (limited sources may justify lower scores)
- If web search was needed (knowledge_was_sufficient=False), slightly lower confidence_score"""


# ===== JSON RESPONSE FORMAT =====

EVALUATION_JSON_FORMAT = """Return a JSON object matching the ResponseEvaluation model:

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no extra text)
- All scores must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Include only the response-type-specific score (clarity_score OR actionability_score OR diagnostic_depth_score)
- Set the other two response-type-specific scores to null
- Ensure strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions are specific and actionable
- Knowledge assessment should reference actual metrics from static_data
